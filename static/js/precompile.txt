So after much trial and error (which is the best way to learn it) here's the way that works for me.

First- externalize all your templates, say you have a template inside script tags like

<script id="tmpl_ownevents" type="text/templates">
    {{#unless event}}
        <div class="notfoundevents"><p>No events for you</p></div>    
    {{/unless}}
</script>

Create a new file called events.tmpl and copy/paste the template into that. Be sure to remove the script elements themselves, this gotcha bit me in the a..

Install the Handlebars commandline script like so

  npm install -g handlebars


go to the folder you have saved profile.tmpl into and run

  handlebars profile.tmpl -f profile.tmpl.js


Include the compiled javascript into your HTML after you included Handlebars.js

<script src="profile.tmpl.js"></script>

Now all that is left is change your normal template code into something resembling the following

var template = Handlebars.templates['profile.tmpl'], // your template minus the .js
    context = profile.all(), // your data
    html    = template(context);

And there you have it, super fast pre-compiled Handlebars templates.
